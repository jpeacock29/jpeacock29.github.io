This data could support research in animal advocacy and other fields seeking to change diet, including reducing the purchase and consumption of animal products. To help build these collaborations, information about the dining services at 66 campuses in the United States was collected. Using this information, we tried to identify campuses which were likely to have detailed information on the food students buy and be willing to collaborate with researchers. We identified three such campuses and 25 campuses that likely do not meet those criteria. Researchers should consider collaborating with the identified campuses, searching for additional campuses as well as alternative research methods that do not require such detailed information.","tags":["Animal advocacy"],"title":"Surveying US College and University Dining Services for Potential Collaboration on Diet Change Research 2017–2018","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacob Peacock","Katie Smith","Maya Kutz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1491523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491523200,"objectID":"652c55b81a67cb06a3fe7c9510d30918","permalink":"https://www.jacobpeacock.com/publication/validation-of-the-visionmaker-nyc-hydrological-model/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T00:43:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/validation-of-the-visionmaker-nyc-hydrological-model/","section":"publication","summary":"Visionmaker NYC is a web-based, user-friendly environmental modeling system for New York City (NYC) created by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). We empirically evaluate the floodwater component of the hydrological model contained within Visionmaker against observed flooding using reports from the NYC 311 help phone line and historical precipitation data. Of the 26 flood events identified from 2015, we tested 10 in Visionmaker and found that in no cases did Visonmaker NYC predict flooding correctly. The simplified \"bucket model\" for precipitation and drainage used by Visionmaker is the likely cause of this disparity and the hydrological model should be adjusted to include time dependence. We also critically evaluate the storm models used by Visionmaker and find significant disparities with other climatic data that should be addressed.","tags":["Machine learning","Environmental science"],"title":"Validation of the Visionmaker NYC Hydrological Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacob Peacock","Ryan R.

The stability of the acyl linkage in each aminoacyl-tRNA, formed through an ester bond that connects the amino acid carboxyl group with the tRNA terminal 3′-OH group, is thus important. While the ester linkage is the same for all aminoacyl-tRNAs, the stability of each is not well characterized, thus limiting insight into the fundamental process of peptide bond formation. Here, we show, by analysis of the half-lives of 12 of the 22 natural aminoacyl-tRNAs used in peptide bond formation, that the stability of the acyl linkage is effectively determined only by the chemical nature of the amino acid side chain. Even the chirality of the side chain exhibits little influence. Proline confers the lowest stability to the linkage, while isoleucine and valine confer the highest, whereas the nucleotide sequence in the tRNA provides negligible contribution to the stability. We find that, among the variables tested, the protein translation factor EF-Tu is the only one that can protect a weak acyl linkage from hydrolysis. These results suggest that each amino acid plays an active role in determining its own stability in the acyl linkage to tRNA, but that EF-Tu overrides this individuality and protects the acyl linkage stability for protein synthesis on the ribosome.","tags":["Biology"],"title":"Amino Acid-Dependent Stabiliy of the Acyl Linkage in aminoacyl-tRNA","type":"publication"}]
