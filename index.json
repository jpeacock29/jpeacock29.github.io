Previous work has begun to develop interventions to reduce individual meat consumption, often by appealing directly to individual health motivations. However, research on nutritional behavior change suggests that interventions additionally linking behavior to ethical values, identity formation, and existing social movements may be particularly effective and longer-lasting. Regarding meat consumption, preliminary evidence and psychological theory suggest that appeals related to animal welfare may have considerable potential to effectively leverage these elements of human psychology. We aim to conduct a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of animal welfare-related appeals on actual or intended meat consumption or purchasing. Our investigation will critically synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding psychological mechanisms of intervening on individual meat consumption and empirically identify the psychological characteristics underlying the most effective animal welfare-based interventions.\n\n*Methods*: This protocol details our planned inclusion criteria, search strategies to identify published and unpublished studies, quality assessment criteria, data extraction methods, and statistical analysis methods that rigorously characterize evidence strength with possible effect heterogeneity and assess for publication bias. We delineate possible follow-up analyses to investigate hypothesized moderators of intervention effectiveness, methods to summarize effect sizes in terms of their direct societal impacts, and methods to compare the effectiveness of appeals regarding animal welfare to those regarding individual health or the environment.\n\n*Discussion*: The findings of the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis, including any identified methodological limitations of the existing literature, could inform the design of successful evidence-based interventions with broad potential to improve human, animal, and environmental well-being.\n\n*Systematic review registration*: The protocol was preregistered via the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/dtxcf/).","tags":["Animal advocacy"],"title":"Reducing Meat Consumption by Appealing to Animal Welfare: Protocol for a Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacob Peacock"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1550620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550620800,"objectID":"d17b7b3de686deb068231eb455f2b14a","permalink":"https://www.jacobpeacock.com/publication/e013r01-surveying-dining-services-2017-2018/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T00:36:38-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/e013r01-surveying-dining-services-2017-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Collaboration with colleges and universities may be a promising opportunity for collecting data on what foods people buy. This data could support research in animal advocacy and other fields seeking to change diet, including reducing the purchase and consumption of animal products.

Using this information, we tried to identify campuses which were likely to have detailed information on the food students buy and be willing to collaborate with researchers. We identified three such campuses and 25 campuses that likely do not meet those criteria. Researchers should consider collaborating with the identified campuses, searching for additional campuses as well as alternative research methods that do not require such detailed information.","tags":["Animal advocacy"],"title":"Surveying US College and University Dining Services for Potential Collaboration on Diet Change Research 2017–2018","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Melvin","Jacob Peacock"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1525392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525392000,"objectID":"7e0867912ea6990a726c5467f76ec5cc","permalink":"https://www.jacobpeacock.com/publication/e005r06-farm-animal-photos/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T05:05:44-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/e005r06-farm-animal-photos/","section":"publication","summary":"This document presents a reanalysis of the data and the conclusions reported by Humane League Labs  on  January  25,  2015,  in  the  blog  post  titled  Report:   Which  farm  animal  photos  are most likely to inspire people to eat vegan?

These proteins can bind to DNA cooperatively, strongly impacting their affinity and specificity. However, current methods for measuring cooperativity do not provide the means to accurately predict binding behavior over a wide range of concentrations.\n\n*Methods*: We use standard computational and mathematical methods, and develop novel methods as described in Results.\n\n*Results*: We explore some complexities of cooperative binding, and develop an improved method for relating *in vitro* measurements to *in vivo* function, based on ternary complex formation. We derive expressions for the equilibria among the various complexes, and explore the limitations of binding experiments that model the system using a single parameter. We describe how to use single-ligand binding and ternary complex formation in tandem to determine parameters that have thermodynamic relevance. We develop an improved method for finding both single-ligand dissociation constants and concentrations simultaneously. We show how the cooperativity factor can be found when only one of the single-protein dissociation constants can be measured.\n\n*Conclusions*: The methods that we develop constitute an optimized approach to accurately model cooperative binding.\n\n*General Significance*: The expressions and methods we develop for modeling and analyzing DNA binding and cooperativity are applicable to most cases where multiple ligands bind to distinct sites on a common substrate. The parameters determined using these methods can be fed into models of higher-order cooperativity to increase their predictive power.

Four AGO proteins are expressed in humans and differential loading of guide miRNAs and tRFs has been observed previously, with AGO2 the least favored for tRF loading (Kumar 2014). To this end, we make a detailed analysis of the tRF guides and their targets in AGO2 for later comparison with AGO4 behavior (Karaiskos 2015).","tags":["Biology"],"title":"Bioinformatic Description of tRNA Fragments and their Targets in Human AGO2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacob Peacock","Ryan R.

The stability of the acyl linkage in each aminoacyl-tRNA, formed through an ester bond that connects the amino acid carboxyl group with the tRNA terminal 3′-OH group, is thus important. While the ester linkage is the same for all aminoacyl-tRNAs, the stability of each is not well characterized, thus limiting insight into the fundamental process of peptide bond formation. Here, we show, by analysis of the half-lives of 12 of the 22 natural aminoacyl-tRNAs used in peptide bond formation, that the stability of the acyl linkage is effectively determined only by the chemical nature of the amino acid side chain. Even the chirality of the side chain exhibits little influence. Proline confers the lowest stability to the linkage, while isoleucine and valine confer the highest, whereas the nucleotide sequence in the tRNA provides negligible contribution to the stability. We find that, among the variables tested, the protein translation factor EF-Tu is the only one that can protect a weak acyl linkage from hydrolysis. These results suggest that each amino acid plays an active role in determining its own stability in the acyl linkage to tRNA, but that EF-Tu overrides this individuality and protects the acyl linkage stability for protein synthesis on the ribosome.","tags":["Biology"],"title":"Amino Acid-Dependent Stabiliy of the Acyl Linkage in aminoacyl-tRNA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matt Desimone","Jacob Peacock"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1312848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1312848000,"objectID":"756373d126e7c040317efbf341801f2d","permalink":"https://www.jacobpeacock.com/publication/northwestern-atlantic-salp-bloom-data-newspaper/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T04:20:53-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/northwestern-atlantic-salp-bloom-data-newspaper/","section":"publication","summary":"Salp blooms are important and generally understudied components of the carbon cycle.
