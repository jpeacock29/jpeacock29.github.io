Previous work has begun to develop interventions to reduce individual meat consumption, often by appealing directly to individual health motivations. However, research on nutritional behavior change suggests that interventions additionally linking behavior to ethical values, identity formation, and existing social movements may be particularly effective and longer-lasting. Regarding meat consumption, preliminary evidence and psychological theory suggest that appeals related to animal welfare may have considerable potential to effectively leverage these elements of human psychology. We aim to conduct a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of animal welfare-related appeals on actual or intended meat consumption or purchasing. Our investigation will critically synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding psychological mechanisms of intervening on individual meat consumption and empirically identify the psychological characteristics underlying the most effective animal welfare-based interventions.

*Methods*: This protocol details our planned inclusion criteria, search strategies to identify published and unpublished studies, quality assessment criteria, data extraction methods, and statistical analysis methods that rigorously characterize evidence strength with possible effect heterogeneity and assess for publication bias. We delineate possible follow-up analyses to investigate hypothesized moderators of intervention effectiveness, methods to summarize effect sizes in terms of their direct societal impacts, and methods to compare the effectiveness of appeals regarding animal welfare to those regarding individual health or the environment.

*Discussion*: The findings of the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis, including any identified methodological limitations of the existing literature, could inform the design of successful evidence-based interventions with broad potential to improve human, animal, and environmental well-being.

*Systematic review registration*: The protocol was preregistered via the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/dtxcf/).">

    <p class="pub-abstract"><p><em>Background</em>: Reducing meat consumption may improve human health, curb environmental damage and greenhouse gas emissions, and limit the large-scale suffering of animals raised in factory farms. Previous work has begun to develop interventions to reduce individual meat consumption, often by appealing directly to individual health motivations. However, research on nutritional behavior change suggests that interventions additionally linking behavior to ethical values, identity formation, and existing social movements may be particularly effective and longer-lasting. Regarding meat consumption, preliminary evidence and psychological theory suggest that appeals related to animal welfare may have considerable potential to effectively leverage these elements of human psychology. We aim to conduct a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of animal welfare-related appeals on actual or intended meat consumption or purchasing. Our investigation will critically synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding psychological mechanisms of intervening on individual meat consumption and empirically identify the psychological characteristics underlying the most effective animal welfare-based interventions.</p>

<p><em>Methods</em>: This protocol details our planned inclusion criteria, search strategies to identify published and unpublished studies, quality assessment criteria, data extraction methods, and statistical analysis methods that rigorously characterize evidence strength with possible effect heterogeneity and assess for publication bias. We delineate possible follow-up analyses to investigate hypothesized moderators of intervention effectiveness, methods to summarize effect sizes in terms of their direct societal impacts, and methods to compare the effectiveness of appeals regarding animal welfare to those regarding individual health or the environment.</p>
